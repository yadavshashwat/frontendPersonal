    "bio2": "Throughout my career, not only have I pursued opportunities which can satisfy my passion but also sought creative tech-enabled ways to solve complex/ambiguous business-problems. Be it at Fractal (for Visa) where I created products to micro-target potential travelers or be it while I was consulting Prime Minister Modi for his 2014 general election campaign. At ClickGarage, a start-up I Co-founded, and which was later acquired by CarCrew Technologies, I conceptualized a cloud-based tool to manage partner workshops. The tool offerings multi-billion-dollar clients such as Uber and brought standardization to a highly fragmented after-sale automotive industry.",
